# HospitalApp
Created an application that simulates a hospital using Java. This program expresses object-oriented programming. It stores different employees with different information into different arrays from a text file. 
The user is prompted with a user-friendly UI where they can display, add, or delete employees. The output is very clear and easy for the user to understand
The code ends when the user decides to exit the program by entering the number 4, which will make the program stop.
